# PontoNanny: Smart Babysitter Time Tracking

PontoNanny is a visually stunning, minimalist web application designed for seamless time tracking for babysitters. It provides a simple, elegant interface for a babysitter named Dilma to clock in, clock out, and manage breaks, all with integrated geolocation capture. For the employer, Carla, it offers a comprehensive dashboard with detailed reports, work summaries, and graphical visualizations of hours worked. The application is built on Cloudflare's edge network, ensuring high performance and reliability. There is no authentication; the app operates with two fixed, pre-defined profiles, allowing for instant access to the respective dashboards via a beautiful profile selection screen.
